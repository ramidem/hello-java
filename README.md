# Hello, Java!

[Learning Java](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-java-programmer)!

## Running the program

1. Compile it first.
    ```sh
    javac src.UpdateStudentGpa.java
    ```

2. Run the program to output `Hello, World!`.
    ```sh
    java src.UpdateStudentGpa
    ```

## Building Strong Foundations

### Data Types

| **Primitive Types**                | **Reference Types**                                              |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Boolean** true eor false value   | **String** a sequence of ordered characters. e.g. word, sentence |
| **Int** a whole number             |                                                                  |
| **Double** a decimal number        |                                                                  |
| **Char** a single letter or symbol |                                                                  |

## Control Flow

### Comparison Operators in Java

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

| **Operator** | **Name**                 | **Example** |
|--------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| `==`         | Equal to                 | `x == y`    |
| `!=`         | Not Equal                | `x != y`    |
| `>`          | Greater Than             | `x > y`     |
| `<`          | Less Than                | `x < y`     |
| `>=`         | Greater than or equal to | `x >= y`    |
| `<=`         | Less than or equal to    | `x <= y`    |

### Scope

- The scope of a variable is the part of the program where a piece of code is accessible or in which it can be used.
- Curly braces create different blocks or regions in Java.
- The `if` block and the `else` block are separate because they are in different sets of curly brackets.

### Loops

A loop allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a Boolean condition. One of them is **while** loop.

#### While Loop

The `while` loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is `true`. [src](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_while_loop.asp)

## Functions

A function is a series of finite steps that accomplish some task.

## Classes

> A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. [src](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-objects-java/)

- A class can be instantiated by calling the **constructor** -- creates and initializes instances -- of a class that create an instance or object of the type of class.
- Classes which contain attributes (properties) and behavior (methods) help organize code.
- Some attributes are associated with each individual instance (instance variables).
- Class variables or static variables are associated with the whole class. Use dot notation on an instantiated class to access the static variable.
